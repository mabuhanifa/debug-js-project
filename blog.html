      <h4>
        Q1: What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Answer: The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do
        with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data
        is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the
        browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.
        while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
        cleared when the page session ends.

      <h4>Q2: What's the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h4>
      <p>
        Variables declared outside of all functions are known as global
        variables and in the global scope. Global variables are accessible
        anywhere in the program. Whereas Block Scope is variable that is
        declared inside a specific block & can’t be accessed outside of that
        block. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need
        to create object for it.

      <h4>Q3: How does Event Loop work in JS?</h4>
      <p>
        How does the event loop work in node JS?Event loop is an endless loop,
        which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives
        more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when
        the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The Event Loop
        has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
        If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event
        from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively
        runs it.

      <h4>Q4: In how many ways can we get 'undefined' in JS?</h4>
      <p>
        An undefined value means lack of value. A variable or an object has an
        undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. undefined is
        a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global
        scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
        Examples: Strict equality and undefined, typeof operator and undefined,
        void operator and undefined.
